    <h2 style="color:gray;">ACT 1</h2>

<h3 style="color:gray;">PROLOGUE</h3>

Two households, both alike in dignity,<br>
In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,<br>
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,<br>
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.<br>
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes<br>
A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;<br>
Whose misadventured piteous overthrows<br>
Do with their death bury their parents' strife.<br>
The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,<br>
And the continuance of their parents' rage,<br>
Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,<br>
Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;<br>
The which if you with patient ears attend,<br>
What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.

<h3 style="color:gray;">SCENE I. Verona. A public place.</h3>

<i style="font-size: small;">Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers</i><br>
<br>
<span style="color:gray; font-weight: bold;">SAMPSON</span> <br>
<br>
Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:gray; font-weight: bold;">GREGORY</span><br>
<br>
No, for then we should be colliers.
